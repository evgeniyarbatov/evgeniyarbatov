Hi, I am Evgeny Arbatov.

I am a full-stack engineer who likes to make sense of data. 

I work with JavaScipt, TypeScript, Python and Golang. I use Pandas for all kinds of adhoc analysis. 

I am currently learning React / Vue and rediscovering the joy of coding with ChatGPT.

Things I am interested in are time series analysis, geospatial data processing, music, running and astronomy.

Here are some of the fun projects I am working on:

- visualizing [marathon running records](https://github.com/evgeniyarbatov/marathons)
- using Stellarium to [create videos of the night sky](https://github.com/evgeniyarbatov/stargazing-on-the-run) I see while out on my runs
