# Full-Stack Developer

## What I work on
I build tools for GPS data processing, cloud infrastructure, and data analysis. Most of my recent work focuses on geospatial technologies and automating deployments.

## Technologies I use
**Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Go, JavaScript, Lua  
**Data work**: Jupyter Notebooks, statistical analysis, data visualization  
**Infrastructure**: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform  
**Geospatial**: GPX file processing, mapping, route analysis  

## Recent projects
- GPS data processing tools (anonymization, route optimization, mapping)
- Fitness device data analysis (Garmin vs Polar comparison)
- Various mapping and route generation tools

Currently interested in roles involving full-stack development, data engineering, or cloud infrastructure.
