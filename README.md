## What I Work On 

My work centers around data exploration to build practical applications along the way. I tend to solve problems I encounter myself. Recently, I have been working with maps and location data. I build backends and integrate APIs with minimal frontends to make them usable.

## Why I Code 

For me writing code is a creative endeavor. My main interest is in bringing ideas to life and creating systems that do useful work. What I aim to achieve are the designs that are as simple as possible and are reliable. I find inspiration from looking at nature.

## How I Became Data Engineer 

The story of my interest in data begins with being bored writing SQL queries. As I would struggle and slowly learn new evidence, a picture would emerge. It was very much like detective work where you have clues and use logic to solve a puzzle. 

The next step came on one of the weekend runs. I thought that there was a lot of data collected by fitness watches but we do not know what to do with all of it. I decided to spend time exploring and making sense of fitness and location data. 

Getting lost during the ultra running races made me think more deeply about maps, navigation and practical limitations of the devices I carry. Inspired by finding new places to run in my neighborhood I explored OpenStreetMaps and GNSS systems.
