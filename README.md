# Full-Stack Developer

## What I work on
I build tools for GPS data processing, cloud infrastructure, and data analysis. Most of my recent work focuses on geospatial technologies and automating deployments.

## Technologies I use
**Languages**: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Java <br>
**Data work**: Jupyter Notebooks, statistical analysis, data visualization  
**Infrastructure**: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform  
**Geospatial**: GPX file processing, mapping, route analysis  

## Current projects
- **GPS processing ecosystem**: Route optimization, data anonymization, mapping visualization, accuracy analysis
- **Fitness device research**: Comparing Garmin vs Polar tracking, GNSS satellite positioning
- **Cloud automation**: Kubernetes deployments with Terraform, on-demand EC2 provisioning
- **Route generation**: Custom GPX creation for running routes using OpenStreetMap data

## Notable repositories

## Background
I work with everything from data science notebooks to cloud infrastructure, with a particular focus on geospatial data and route optimization. Currently interested in roles involving full-stack development, data engineering, or cloud infrastructure.
