Hi, I am Evgeny Arbatov.

I am a full-stack engineer who likes to make sense of data. I work with JavaScipt, TypeScript, Python and Golang to build projects that interest me. I like working with data and use Pandas for all kinds of adhoc analysis. I have interest in automating things and making distributed systems work. I picked up Terraform and Kubernetes to get better at that. I am currently learning React and Vue.
