Hi, I am Evgeny Arbatov.

I am a full-stack engineer who likes to make sense of data. 

I work with JavaScipt, TypeScript, Python and Golang. I use Pandas for all kinds of adhoc analysis. 

I am currently learning React / Vue and rediscovering the joy of coding with ChatGPT.

Things I am interested in are time series analysis, geospatial data processing, music, running and astronomy.
