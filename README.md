## What I Work On 

My work centers around data exploration to build practical applications along the way. I tend to solve problems I encounter myself and therefore work with systems that do not require scaling to millions of users. Recently, I have been working with maps and location data. I tend to build backends and integrate APIs with minimal frontends to make them usable.

## Why I Code 

For me writing code is a creative endeavor. My main interest is in bringing ideas to life and creating systems that do useful work. What I aim to achieve are the designs that are as simple as possible and are reliable. I detest complexity, dead code and lack of vision. In my work I find inspiration from looking at nature to create works that last.

## How I Became Data Engineer 

The story of my interest in data begins with being very bored writing SQL queries. Occasionally I would encounter a problem that I was not able to solve. These were the complete opposite. As I would struggle and slowly learn new evidence, a picture would emerge. It was very much like detective work where you have clues and use logic to solve a puzzle. 

The next step came on one of the weekend runs. I thought that there was much data collected by fitness watches but we do not know what to do with all of it. The experience of being tethered to a device that is more intelligent than myself felt very odd. I decided to spend time exploring and making sense of fitness and location data. 

Getting lost during the ultra running races was what made me think more deeply about maps, navigation and practical limitations of the devices I carry. Around the same time I moved to Hanoi where finding a safe place to run became a challenge. This gave me inspiration to explore Open Street Maps, as well as dive into GNSS system and location accuracy.
