# Fullstack Engineer

I build tools and prototypes in Python and JavaScript/React along with Docker, Terraform, and API integrations. 

My work centers on geospatial data (OSM, GPX/TCX, routing) and visualization.

## Technologies I use
**Languages**: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java <br>
**Data work**: Jupyter Notebooks, statistical analysis, data visualization  
**Infrastructure**: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform  
**Geospatial**: GPX file processing, mapping, route analysis  

## Current projects
- **GPS processing ecosystem**: Route optimization, data anonymization, mapping visualization, accuracy analysis
- **Fitness device research**: Comparing Garmin vs Polar tracking, GNSS satellite positioning
- **Route generation**: Custom GPX creation for running routes using OpenStreetMap data
