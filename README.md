## How I Became Data Engineer

The story of my interest in data begins with being very bored writing SQL queries. Occasionally I would encounter a problem that I was not able to solve. These were the complete opposite. As I would struggle and slowly learn new evidence, a picture would emerge. It was very much like the detective work where you have clues and use logic to solve a puzzle. 

The next step came on one of the weekend runs. I thought that there was much data collected by fitness watches but we do not know what to do with all of it. The experience of being tethered to a device that is more intelligent than myself felt very odd. I decided to spend time exploring and making sense of fitness and location data. 

Getting lost during the ultra running races was what made think more deeply about maps, navigation and practical limitation of the devices I carry. Around the same time I moved to Hanoi where finding a safe place to run became a challenge. This gave me inspiration to explore Open Street Maps, as well as dive into GNSS system and location accuracy.
