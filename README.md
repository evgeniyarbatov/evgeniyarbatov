## What I Work On

My work focuses on data exploration—combining multiple, often unrelated data sources to build practical, real-world applications. I usually tackle problems I’ve encountered myself, which means I work on systems that prioritize usefulness over massive scale.

Lately, I’ve been working extensively with maps and location data. I naturally gravitate toward backend development, with an emphasis on integrating APIs. When needed, I build minimal frontends to make these tools accessible and easy to use.

## Why I Code

For me, writing code is a creative endeavor. I'm driven by the challenge of bringing ideas to life and building systems that do meaningful, useful work. My goal is to design solutions that are as simple and reliable as possible. 

I have a strong dislike for unnecessary complexity, dead code, and projects without clear direction. In my work, I draw inspiration from nature—seeking to create systems that are both elegant and enduring.

## How I Became a Data Engineer

My journey into data began in an unexpected way—through boredom with SQL queries. Most of the time, they felt routine. But every so often, I’d encounter a problem I couldn’t immediately solve. Those moments turned into valuable learning experiences. As I worked through various datasets and gradually uncovered patterns and relationships, I felt like a detective piecing together clues.

A turning point came during one of my weekend runs. I realized how much data fitness watches collect—and how little of it we truly use. Being tethered to a device that sometimes seemed smarter than me felt oddly unsettling, and it sparked my curiosity. I began exploring fitness and location data to make better sense of it.

Getting lost during ultra-running races deepened my interest even more. I started thinking seriously about maps, navigation, and the real-world limitations of the devices I relied on. Around the same time, I moved to Hanoi, where simply finding a safe place to run became a challenge. This led me to explore OpenStreetMap, GNSS systems, and the nuances of location accuracy.
