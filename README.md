## How I Became Data Engineer

My journey into data began in an unexpected way—through boredom with SQL queries. Most of the time, they felt routine. But every so often, I’d encounter a problem I couldn’t immediately solve. Those moments turned into valuable learning experiences. As I worked through various datasets and gradually uncovered patterns and relationships, I felt like a detective piecing together clues.

A turning point came during one of my weekend runs. I realized how much data fitness watches collect—and how little of it we truly use. Being tethered to a device that sometimes seemed smarter than me felt oddly unsettling, and it sparked my curiosity. I began exploring fitness and location data to make better sense of it.

Getting lost during ultra-running races deepened my interest even more. I started thinking seriously about maps, navigation, and the real-world limitations of the devices I relied on. Around the same time, I moved to Hanoi, where simply finding a safe place to run became a challenge. This led me to explore OpenStreetMap, GNSS systems, and the nuances of location accuracy.
